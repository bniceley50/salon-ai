## 💭 The Pricing Mindset

**Remember**: You're not charging for features. You're charging for:
1. Time saved (20+ hours/week)
2. Disasters prevented ($2,400 each)
3. Revenue increased (30% more appointments)
4. Stress reduced (priceless)
5. Professional growth (master colorist in pocket)

When positioned correctly, $297/month isn't a cost. It's the best investment a salon can make.

**Price confidently. Deliver obsessively. Scale intelligently.**
