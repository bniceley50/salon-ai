## File Structure

```
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ core/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ colorAI/
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ ColorSafetyCheck.js  # Core safety logic
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ index.js             # API wrapper
â””â”€â”€ api/
    â””â”€â”€ server.js                # Express server

integration-test.js              # Test real implementation
start-mvp.js                    # Launch script
```

## Revenue Formula

```
Salons Ã— $97/month = MRR
Prevention Rate Ã— Disaster Cost = Value Delivered

Example:
100 salons Ã— $97 = $9,700 MRR
25% prevention Ã— $1,250/disaster = $31,250 value/month
```
