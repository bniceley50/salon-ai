  - Metric collection accuracy
  - Alert threshold appropriateness
  - Debugging capability
  
- **Deployment Concerns**
  - Environment variable management
  - Secret rotation capability
  - Zero-downtime deployment support
  - Rollback mechanisms

### 10. Specific High-Risk Areas

Please pay special attention to these files:
1. **webhook_security_handler.js** - Critical for preventing unauthorized access
2. **square_integration_production.js** - Handles all payment processing
3. **incident_response_automation.js** - Automated disaster response
4. **voice_whatsapp_integration.js** - Voice command processing
5. **viral_growth_system.js** - Reddit automation (check for API abuse)

## Specific Tests to Run

### Security Tests
```javascript
// Test webhook signature validation
- Attempt to send unsigned webhooks
- Try replay attacks with old timestamps
- Test with malformed signatures
- Verify rate limiting works

// Test input validation
- SQL injection attempts in all text fields
- XSS payloads in appointment notes
- Path traversal in file operations
- Command injection in voice commands
```

### Business Logic Tests
```javascript
// Test booking system
- Attempt double booking same slot
- Book across timezone boundaries
- Cancel non-existent appointments
- Test with daylight saving time changes

// Test color formula AI
- Input dangerous chemical combinations
- Test extreme porosity values
- Verify disaster prevention triggers
- Test with incomplete data
```

### Load Tests
```javascript
// Simulate viral Reddit moment
- 10,000 concurrent booking attempts
- 1,000 simultaneous voice commands
- Webhook bombardment test
- Database connection pool exhaustion
```

### Financial Tests
