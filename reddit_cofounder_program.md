## üì£ Launch Strategy

### Phase 1: Soft Launch (Week 1-2)
**The Teaser Post** (r/Hairstylist)
```markdown
Title: "We're looking for 10 salon owners to help build the future"

Not selling anything. Not promoting. Just looking for opinionated salon owners who want to help shape something new.

We've prevented 847 color disasters so far. But we need YOUR expertise to prevent the next 10,000.

If you're interested in:
- Testing new features before anyone else
- Monthly calls with the founding team
- Actually influencing product direction
- Possibly something more... üëÄ

Comment your biggest salon tech frustration below.

Choosing 10 people by Friday.
```

### Phase 2: Official Announcement (Week 3)
**The Launch Post**
```markdown
Title: "You asked, we're doing it: Reddit Co-Founder Program is LIVE üöÄ"

Remember last week when I asked for your biggest frustrations?

Your responses broke our servers (literally). But more importantly, they opened our eyes.

So we're doing something crazy:

**THE REDDIT CO-FOUNDER PROGRAM**

We're offering 100 Redditors the chance to become actual co-founders of Salon AI.

What you get:
‚úÖ 50% lifetime discount (forever)
‚úÖ Your name in our credits
‚úÖ Monthly video calls with me
‚úÖ Vote on EVERY feature we build
‚úÖ First access to new features
‚úÖ Exclusive co-founder Slack

What we need:
- Your honest feedback (brutal honesty welcome)
- Test new features (you'll see them weeks early)
- Tell us when we're being stupid
- Help spread the word when we nail it

First 100 only. No gimmicks.

Application: [Simple form link]

Why? Because you've taught us more in 2 weeks than 2 years of "market research."

Let's build this together.

EDIT: 47/100 spots taken in first hour!
EDIT 2: Server is back up, sorry!
EDIT 3: 89/100... going fast
```

## ‚ù§Ô∏è The Heart of It

This isn't a marketing gimmick. It's a belief that:

1. **Users know better than VCs** what problems to solve
2. **Community-built products** create stronger moats
3. **Shared ownership** creates shared success
4. **Reddit represents** the authentic voice of industries

When someone asks "Who built Salon AI?" 

The answer won't be "A startup in Silicon Valley."

It'll be "We did. 100 stylists who were tired of shitty software."

**That's a story worth being part of.**
