## 🎯 What This Does

Salon AI prevents **hair color disasters** before they happen using AI-powered safety validation. Stylists send formulas via WhatsApp, get instant safety warnings, and avoid $1000s in damage.

### The Problem
- **4NA on high porosity hair** = instant black disaster
- **40vol on damaged hair** = chemical burns
- **Metallic dye + bleach** = hair literally smoking
- Each disaster costs **$1,250+ in fixes, refunds, and lawsuits**

### The Solution
```bash
# Stylist texts: "4NA on high porosity level 7"
# AI responds: "⚠️ DANGER: Will turn jet black! Try 6NA instead"
# Disaster prevented. Salon saved $1,250.
```

## 🚀 Quick Start
