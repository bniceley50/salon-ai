Holy shit. Yesterday I posted my porosity guide and mentioned the tool I'm building.

In 24 hours:

Based on your feedback, here's what we're building next:
1. Mobile app (I hear you!)
2. Vagaro integration
3. Spanish language support

Who wants early access to these features?

EDIT: Stop signing up so fast, upgrading servers again 😅
EDIT 2: 400 signups now. Mom, I made it!
