## 📱 Ad Variant 1: The Disaster Prevention Hook

**Primary Text:**
```
That sick feeling when bleach hits high-porosity hair and you KNOW it's going wrong? 

Sarah felt it last week. But her phone buzzed: "❌ STOP! This formula will cause severe damage."

She adjusted. Client left happy. Disaster avoided.

This is what 847 stylists woke up to this morning - an AI that catches mistakes BEFORE they happen.

💬 Comment "SAVE" to get early access (closing at 1,000 stylists)

## 📱 Ad Variant 2: The Productivity Multiplier

**Primary Text:**
```
Maria does 6 colors every Saturday.

Last week? She did 9.

No rushing. No stress. Just her new AI assistant handling the formulas while she focuses on what she loves - making clients beautiful.

She made an extra $400. In one day.

This is why stylists are calling it their "secret weapon" 🤫

That's what I posted on Reddit after sharing my color disaster prevention tool.

In 72 hours:
- 2,400 upvotes
- 500 stylists signed up
- 14 disasters already prevented
- 3 marriage proposals (kidding... sort of)

The waitlist is getting crazy. But Reddit fam gets priority.

## 📱 Ad Variant 4: The Emotional Safety Net

**Primary Text:**
```
Remember your first major color correction?

The client in tears. You staying late. Spending YOUR money on products to fix it. Going home exhausted, defeated.

What if someone had whispered in your ear: "Don't use 40vol on her hair. Trust me."

That's what this does. It's like having a master colorist watching over your shoulder - but without the judgment.

Because we've all been there. And you shouldn't have to be there again.

💪 Join 847 stylists who'll never feel that fear again

## 🎯 The Ultimate Test

If your ads don't make stylists think:
1. "This would have saved me last week"
2. "I need to share this with my salon"
3. "Finally, someone gets it"

They need work.

Every ad should feel like it was written BY a stylist FOR a stylist who's been there.

Because authenticity scales. BS doesn't.
